[Understanding Lantency and Storage Performace] (http://louwrentius.com/understanding-iops-latency-and-storage-performance.html)

Input/Output operations per second (IOPS)

Latency: How fast a single I/O request is handled

1000 IOPS with an average latency of 10ms may get better than
5000 IOPS with an average latency of 50ms
| Especifically if the application is sensitive to latency, such as a database

```
  [IO]  [IO]  [IO]
-------------------> Time
  10ms  10ms  10ms
```

```
                            20ms
                     <--------------------->
                    [       wait     ][ IO ]
              [       wait     ][ IO ]
        [       wait     ][ IO ]

- Generate data:
1. For each IO Depth { 04 08 16 32 64 128 } (static)
1. Read and Write 100MB (default value), configured by [ConfigMap](/manifests/kubernetes/configmap.yaml)
1. Generate output (json+logs)

- Plot Data:
1. Read generated data (JSON files)
1. Plot into PNG images (latency + iops charts)
1. [WIP] Generate latency histogram per queue depth

- Serve:
1. Simple http server to show the images generated by the previous steps
